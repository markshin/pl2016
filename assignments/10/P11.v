(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, advanced, optional (is_wp_formal)  *)
(** Prove formally using the definition of [hoare_triple] that [Y <= 4]
   is indeed the weakest precondition of [X ::= Y + 1] with respect to
   postcondition [X <= 5]. *)

Theorem is_wp_example :
  is_wp (fun st => st Y <= 4)
    (X ::= APlus (AId Y) (ANum 1)) (fun st => st X <= 5).
Proof.
  exact GIVEUP.
Qed.
